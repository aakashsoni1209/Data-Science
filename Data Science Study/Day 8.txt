Learning Rate
-------------------------------------------------

The lower the learning rate, the higher the iteration we have to perform.

Tensorflow
------------------------------------------------

Scaler -- tensor with degree 0
Vector -- tensor with degree 1
Matrics -- tensor with degree 2

Tensorflow is best for neural network while sklearn is better for preprocessing.
