MNIST dataset (HandWritten Digit)
-------------------------------------

It is called as the "Hello world" of the machine learning.

Action plan for the MNIST Problem
------------------------------------

1. Outline the model and choose the activation function.
2. Describe the placeholder, variable and other operation.
3. Choose the advanced optimizer.
4. Split the dataset.
5. Initialize the variable.
6. Make it learn.
7. Test the accuracy of the model.

Pre Process the dataset
--------------------------------

1.Balance the dataset
2.Divide the dataset into three parts: training, validation and test -- to prevent overfitting. 
3.Covert the dataset into tensor friendly environment.
