Logistic Regression
--------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the problem we see are not as linear.
Regression are base for some of the modal.
Logistic Regression correspond to problem with 1 or 0 , yes or no, will buy or don't buy

Linear Regression line won't fit to the base for the logistic Regression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since it is either 0 or 1, so it can't be predicted with linear regrssion line.
It's voilates the first assumption of linear regression i.e., Linearity
For this modal, we will be using logit modal and it's equation is very similar to what we have for linear regression.

In Logistic Regression, we sometimes use log/exponential function which is quite useful.

Overfitting and Underfitting
---------------------------------------------------

Overfitting means having modal high accuracy but have missed the point.
Underfitting means the modal is not having good accuracy.

Underfitting is easier to find as its having low accuracy, on the other day Overfitting are mucch harder to figure out.

CLustered Analysis
--------------------------------------------------

CLustered Analysis is the way of grouping the data based on the feature.
The main goal of CLustered Analysis is to find the similarity and dissimilarity between the different clustered.

The main implementation of clustering is on Market Segmentation, Image Segmentation. 

Classification (More of a supervised Learning having labelled data)
---------------------------------------------------

Predicting an output data, given input data. 

Mathematical Prerequisite for Clustered Analysis
-----------------------------------------------------

1.Elucidian distance -- the distance between the two point in the space. (2,3,n dimension)
2.Centroid -- Center point between the two points.

K-Means Clustering
-----------------------------------------------------

K-Means Clustering is the most popular method of clustered analysis.

This include 4 steps:

1. Choose the number of cluster (that's why it is called k-means k is the number for cluster)
2. Specify the cluster seed -- based on some calculation put the point on the graph which later becomes centroid
3. Assign each point to the centroid.
4. Adjust the centroid.

K-Means 
-----------------------------------------------------

When using 2 features,we are in puzzle for that because it is getting ddifficult to show in graphs.
What do to??

WCSS -- Within cluster sum of squares is the parameter that should be kept in mind, it will tell how many cluster is essential for the analysis.
WCSS forms Elbow structure.

Pros and Cons
--------------------------------------------------

Pros: 
1.Easy to implement
2.Simple to understand
3.Widely available	
4.Fast to cluster
5.Always yield a result *

Cons with Remedies:
1.We need to pick K 				---------- The Elbow method
2.Sensitive to initialization 		---------- k-means++
3.Sensitive to Outliers 			---------- Remove Outliers
4.Produces spherical solutions
5.Standardrization
