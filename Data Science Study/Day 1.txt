Regression Analysis

1.Linear Regression Model (Simple)
------------------------------------

-->> Y = b0 + b1*x + e

Y @ the varaible that needs to be predicted. (Dependant varaible)
b0 @ constant
b1 @ quantify the amount of Y by x times.
x @ predictor (Independant varaible)
e @ error (error between the predicted one and actual one) -->> on average this value is 0.

Example : 

Y -->> Income 
x -->> Education

The more education you have, the more income you get.
In USA, b1 becomes 5000 for each additional education (x).

As geek symbols are there, which means the above equation is Population one.

-->> y = b0 + b1*x (sample eqaution.)

2. Regression and Correlation
-------------------------------------

Regression is about casuality between the value.
Correlation is about relationship between the varaible.

Regression eqaution -- interchange the varaible in equation affect the whole equation.
Correlation eqaution --  interchange the varaible in equation does not affect the whole equation.

Regression is about best fitting line in the graph.
Correlation is a single point.

3. Essential library used
-------------------------------------

Numpy -->> for manipulation of large data (Example -- ndimensional array)
Pandas -->> For manipulation of the dataset provided.
scipy -->> Scientific method inside the python ecosystem.
statsmodal -->> For statistical representation of the dataset.
matplotlib -->> For 2D modelling of the insight/results found.
seaborn -->> build on top of matplotlib. For more modelling other than basic one provided for visualization.
sklearn -->> Machine learning library. (scikit-learn)
