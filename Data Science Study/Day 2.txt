Seaborn library for data visualization
-----------------------------------------

import seaborn as sns
sns.set() -->> This method will override the matplotlib library method for better visualization.

ANOVA
------------------------------------------

Three concept are important :

1. Sum of square Total (SST)       
2. Sum of square Regression (SSR)
3. Sum of square Error (SSE)

SST = SSR + SSE

Total variability = Explained Variability + Unexplained Variability
Lowering the value of SSE will increase the modal fitability.

OLS
-------------------------------------------

It stands for ordinary least square
The purpose of the function/method is to draw a regression line which is at least distance from all the data points. 
Other method are also present out there such as gaussian/kernel/bayseain regression.

R-squared
-------------------------------------------

The more relevant factor you include in your regression,the better the modal become which result in better R-squared value.
R-squared is the parameter, that determine the modal explanation in terms of factor involved.

Multiple linear Regression modal
-------------------------------------------

one dependant and multi-independant variable.
Its not about best fitting line, it's about best fitting modal.

y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ........ + b(k)*x(k)
