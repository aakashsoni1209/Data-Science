Machine Learning and Deep Learning
----------------------------------------------

Four main ingredient for training:
1.Data
2.Model -- most common linear modal (basis of complex structure)
3.Objective Function -- how well the modal works incontrast with the target value
	3.1 Loss function   -- less the loss function, the accuracy is better 	-- used in supervised learning.
	3.2 Reward function -- opposite of the loss fucntion 					-- used in reinforcement learning.
4.Optimization Algorithm -- gradient descent 	 

Machine Learning types:
1.Supervised
	1.1 Regression     -- common loss function is L2-norm 		-- the output of the function is the number. (continuous)
	1.2 Classification -- common loss function is cross-entropy.
2.Unsupervised
3.Reinforcement

Linear Model Eqaution
-----------------------------------------------

y = wx+b  (w=weight,b=bias)

Every modal depends on the weights and the bias.
